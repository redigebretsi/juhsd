# Project Organization
 We used **Scrum software development**  method to organize our project. We started by defining protocols which helped us to clearly understand what we are going to do. We divided tasks in sprint and had meeting once in two weeks.
In each meeting we track what have done and what is remaining. This helped us to manage our time properly.


##Difficulties we face
1.	Understanding the problem took many of our time even though everything was explained in the lab session it was difficult to start the programming.
2.	Java-Socket programming was new concept for most of the group members, learning the new environment was also time taking.
3.	Working as a group is difficult to manage timing but github helped us to collaborate and ease our work


###Lesson learned and technologies/applications used
1.	Understanding cheese-coin system
2.	understanding how peer to peer protocol works works on application level
3.	understanding and working with Java Socket programming to implement peer to peer programming              
4.	working with My-sql for database
5.	J-unit Automation for testing the project 
6.	Git Hub for managing the project
